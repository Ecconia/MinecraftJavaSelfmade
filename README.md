# MinecraftJavaSelfmade

A Minecraft client written in Java from scratch.

It was one of the days again, when MC pissed me off... Broken chat, weird graphics, well you know what 1.13.2 has to offer.

## Start

This project starts very messy in git. The first refactoring has already been done to improve the code. But the second will come soon this time gitted.

Before the cleanup its not worth looking at the code.

## Furture plans

* The most essential thing is the chat feature.
    - Better GUI
    - Tabcompletion/History
    - on click/hover
* Its not yet decided if 3D will be added, if so in a simple version and slowly improving.
    - If there won't be a main menu, but a main SP world, maybe a floating island.
* For debugging/logging a special GUI with tabs, if possible allow moving the tabs.
    - Chunkmap, shows which chunks are loaded/unloaded/downloaded.
* For debugging an overview over the data collected.
* Offline playing if connection is lost, never dump chunks and other data.
    - While at it, just save the whole server too.
    - Disconnect player from actual position.
* errr...

## Current Features

* Connecting with any online-mode server
  * Compression
  * Encryption
  * Keep-Alive auto-sending
* Printing chat messages in a special window, and chatting from that window.

##### As most of Ecconias YOLO projects, its a learning project.
