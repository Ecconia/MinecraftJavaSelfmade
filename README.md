# MinecraftJavaSelfmade

A Minecraft client written in Java from scratch.

It was one of the days again, when MC pissed me off... Broken chat, weird graphics, well you know what 1.13.2 has to offer.

## Start

This project starts very messy in git. The first refactoring has already been done to improve the code. But the second will come soon this time gitted.

Before the cleanup its not worth looking at the code.

## Furture plans

* The most essential thing is the chat feature.
* Its not yet decided if 3D will be added, if so in a simple version and slowly improving.
* errr...

## Current Features

* Connecting with any online-mode server
  * Compression
  * Encryption
  * Keep-Alive auto-sending

##### As most of Ecconias YOLO projects, its a learning project.

You may contribute if you are interested. No guidlines yet though.
