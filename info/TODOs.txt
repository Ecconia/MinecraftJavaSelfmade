Chat:
	Tabcompletion (active > passive)
	Send-history
	Better GUI
	MC chat style
	
Tabframework:
	Better scroll behaviour
	Eventually get rid of it or rewrite/adjust
	
3D:
	Eventually textures
	Yolo, smooth edges
	Entity-positions as markers
	Moving in first person
	Unlock camera
	More than just one (or more) chunk(s) view range
	
Thread:
	Thread to process chunks in background
	In general MOAR threads
	Threadsafe data, or restrict access?
	
Packets:
	Sharing by lookups, instead of if/else
	Multiple adapters to connect to more than one major version
	
Data:
	Create a data collector class (for each connected server)
	Maintain multi-server possibility
	Collect every data the server sends
	Complain if the server sends invalid data (MC does that by default already btw)
	
Downloads/Cache:
	GUI to ask User which world he is in, save all chunks into that world, until world switch
		Its not really possible to detect the world in which a player had spawned. The servers are not verbose enough.
	Load chunks from file system, until they are loaded from the server.
	Allow offline view of the worlds for each server.
		Any offline chunk needs an indicator to be identitfied
	
AI: 
	Automated movement for the player
		No special meaning yet
		Maybe world download
	Path finding
		Just say where, client does the rest
	Auto placement
		Ofc without "hacking", just inputs
