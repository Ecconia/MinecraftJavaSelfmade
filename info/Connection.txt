Incomming/Outcomming byte stream:

1. Normal packet structure:
<size><packetID><content>
> <size> and <packetID> are compressed Integers.
> Content can be anything.

2. With encryption (streamed):
Encry:[<size><packetID><content>]
> The encryption will be started at some point and streamed then.
> Either decrypt byte for byte or use buffering.

3. With compression:
Encry:[<size><compression>Comp:[<packetID><content>]]
> <compression> is a compressed Integer.
> The compression may be 0 as indicator for no compression.
> If the compression is not 0, it is the original size in bytes.

Encryption:
	1. Write the packet content.
	2. Prepend the PacketID.
	3. Compress the packet and prepend the original size.
	4. Prepend the size of the packet.
	5. Encrpyt the packet.
	6. Send the packet as byte stream.
	
Decryption:
	1. Read the byte stream.
	2. Decrypt the byte stream.
	3. Read the size of a packet and collect this packet.
	4. Read the original size and decompress the packet if needed.
	5. Read the packet ID.
	6. Read the content depending on the packet ID.
